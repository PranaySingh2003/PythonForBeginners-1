#Questions 

2. Create a loop that counts from 0 to 100
for ide in range(0,100):
    print(ide)


3. Make a multiplication table using a loop
for i in range(10):
    j=i*
4. Output the numbers 1 to 10 backwards using a loop
5. Create a loop that counts all even numbers to 10
for i in range(0,10,2):
    print(i)

6. Create a loop that sums the numbers from 100 to 200

sum=0
for i in range(100,200):
    sum = sum + i
    print(sum)


# While Loop

x = 3                              
while x < 10:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1




while True:
    print('Forever')
